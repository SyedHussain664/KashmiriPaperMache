# KashmiriPaperMache
Kashmiri Paper Mâché is a 14th-century art introduced by Persian artists and refined by locals. Made from waste paper pulp, it is molded, smoothed, and hand-painted with motifs like flowers and birds. Used for boxes, trays, and vases, it reflects Kashmir’s rich culture but now struggles against cheap imitations.
